# Acquia IP Whitelist

# EDIT: 21 March 2016 - The old IP listing page may be found here: https://docsdev.network.acquia-sites.com/network/manage/ipaddress
# The new page instructs users to contact Support for Acquia's IP addresses - presumably to prevent our IP addresses from being indexed by search engines
# https://docs.acquia.com/network/access/ip-whitelist

# Please verify that these IP addresses are valid; this page used to work on the assumoption that the public-facing docs.acquia.com page would have the most recent information.
